Hey there, I'm Wangxinyang! I'm a Fullstack Engineer.
I have a wide range of interests in technology that I love to do some small tool for myself.

When I was worked for my job, I studied the java, javascript, golang, rust and frontend languages
for many years.Those study experiences were makes me as quickly as possible to study some new things.

Aside from work, I like running and play games.Now I play the Unicorn Overlord in Nintendo switch.
I also want to try develop some toy games with Rust and Bevy. I will try it later.
