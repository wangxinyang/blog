3.Recently I need a new laptop for personal use since my trusty Dell Precision 5510 broke down (I spilled a bow of soup on it).
After careful consideration between Thinkpads, XPSes and Macbook Air M1, I decided to go with the M1 because:

- [x] Awesome battery life
- [x] Lightweight
- [x] Nice screen
- [x] Relatively powerful
