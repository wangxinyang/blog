This is a my personal blog at <>, written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
using the [Leptos](https://leptos.dev) framework, and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Creating your template repo

If you don't have `cargo-leptos` installed you can install it with

```bash
cargo install cargo-leptos
```

Then run

```bash
cargo leptos new --git leptos-rs/start-axum
```

to generate a new project template.

```bash
cd my-blog
```

to go to your newly created project.  
Feel free to explore the project structure, but the best place to start with your application code is in `src/app.rs`.  
Addtionally, Cargo.toml may need updating as new versions of the dependencies are released, especially if things are not working after a `cargo update`.

## Running your project

```bash
cargo leptos watch
```

## Installing Additional Tools

By default, `cargo-leptos` uses `nightly` Rust, `cargo-generate`, and `sass`. If you run into any trouble, you may need to install one or more of these tools.

1. `rustup toolchain install nightly --allow-downgrade` - make sure you have Rust nightly
2. `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` - add the ability to compile Rust to WebAssembly
3. `cargo install cargo-generate` - install `cargo-generate` binary (should be installed automatically in future)
4. `npm install -g sass` - install `dart-sass` (should be optional in future

## Compiling for Release

```bash
cargo leptos build --release
```

Will generate your server binary in target/server/release and your site package in target/site
